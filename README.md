# DBMS-Elections-Project
I have designed an Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and a Crows feet notation pattern in Microsoft Visio platform.
Uploaded the given excel file and modified it as per the requirement and developed a web page in apex-oracle. 
Also, created an another excel file names as  “Elections” that contains data regarding the elections and joined with the modified file to know which political party got more donations.
